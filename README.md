# aspnetcoreapitemplate
This is my very simple template for creating API with ASP.NET Core including:

CQRS Pattern,
SeriLog,
Exception handler middleware,
Swagger,

Example of usage is implemented in TestController class

Master branch will contain only the basic features. If u want to include some other feature, you can marge with other branches contained specyfied features. 


Currently TO DO:
- separate logs by envirovment name 
- new branch with windows authentication, generating JWT token etc
- new branch with basic authentication, generating JWT token etc
- new branch with docker support
